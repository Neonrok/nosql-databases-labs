## Assessment

### Lab Exercises

Each lab includes hands-on exercises that must be completed individually. Students will work with real datasets including:

- Sakila film database
- AirBnB listings
- Sample training data
- Social media data

### Group Project

Students will work in groups of 2-3 to design and implement a complete NoSQL database solution for a real-world scenario. Projects include:

- Schema design
- Data import and transformation
- Query implementation
- Performance optimization
- Presentation of findings

## Required Resources

### Software

- MongoDB Community Edition (latest stable version)
- MongoDB Compass (GUI tool)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control
- Docker (optional but recommended)

### Datasets

All required datasets are provided in the course repository:

- `data/sakila/` - Film rental database
- `data/datasets/` - Various sample datasets
- `data/sample_training/` - MongoDB training data

### Recommended Reading

- MongoDB Manual: <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/>
- "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide" by Kristina Chodorow
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Lab sessions are mandatory as they contain hands-on exercises essential for understanding the material.

### Collaboration Policy

- Individual exercises must be completed independently
- Group projects encourage collaboration within teams
- Code sharing between groups is prohibited
- Properly cite all external resources

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted must be original. Plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration will result in course failure.

## Getting Help

### Office Hours

- Instructor: [TBD based on schedule]

### Resources

- Course repository: Access via Git
