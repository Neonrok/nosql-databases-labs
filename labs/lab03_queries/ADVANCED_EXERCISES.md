## Advanced Exercise 0: Diagnostics & Resilience Drills (Bonus Track)

### Objective

Practice real operational workflows: profiling workloads, surviving index outages, and safeguarding data quality.

### Tasks

1. **Query Profiler & Index Advisor**
   - Enable profiling at level 1 (slowms ≈ 5ms) and replay a mix of Task 1/Task 2 queries multiple times.
   - Aggregate `db.system.profile` to surface which query shapes are slowest, examine the most docs, or never use indexes.
   - Create `labs/lab03_queries/profiler.js` to reset profiling data, run the workload, and print the top 5 offenders with metrics `{ns, millisAvg, docsExaminedAvg, usedIndex}`.
   - Document index recommendations or redundant indexes in `diagnostics.md`.

2. **Index Stress Test & Recovery**
   - Pick two “must-have” indexes from Task 3 (e.g., `genres_1_imdb.rating_-1`, `directors_1_year_-1`).
   - Capture explain metrics, drop the indexes, rerun the queries, and note the regression (execution time, docs examined, stage).
   - Recreate the indexes with new options (different field order, partial filter, etc.) and compare results.
   - Summarize lessons learned in `diagnostics.md`: which queries regressed most and which rebuild variant performed best.

3. **Data Integrity Watchdog**
   - Write `labs/lab03_queries/data_quality.js` containing an aggregation pipeline that flags anomalies such as:
     - `imdb.rating` outside 0–10
     - `runtime` ≤ 0
     - Missing/invalid `lastupdated`
     - `awards.wins` present but `awards.text` missing
   - Output documents shaped as `{ _id: { issue: <string> }, count, sampleIds: [...] }` and optionally `$merge` results into `movies_qa`.
   - Add remediation ideas (e.g., normalization rules) to `diagnostics.md`.

### Deliverables

- `labs/lab03_queries/profiler.js`
- `labs/lab03_queries/data_quality.js`
- `labs/lab03_queries/diagnostics.md`

Treat this track as ~45–60 minutes of extra credit; partial results are still valuable if well documented.

## Advanced Exercise 1: Query Pattern Analysis

### Objective

Analyze real-world query patterns and optimize for specific use cases.

### Tasks

1. **Create a Query Profiler**

   Build a script that profiles different query patterns:

   ```javascript
   // Enable profiling
   db.setProfilingLevel(2, { slowms: 1 });

   // Run various queries...

   // Analyze profile collection
   db.system.profile.aggregate([
     {
       $group: {
         _id: { ns: "$ns", op: "$op" },
         count: { $sum: 1 },
         avgTime: { $avg: "$millis" },
         maxTime: { $max: "$millis" },
       },
     },
     { $sort: { avgTime: -1 } },
   ]);
   ```

2. **Identify Query Patterns**
   - Find the top 10 most frequent query patterns
   - Calculate average execution time per pattern
   - Identify queries that would benefit most from indexing

3. **Create a Query Recommendation Engine**
   ```javascript
   function recommendIndex(query) {
     // Analyze query structure
     // Recommend optimal index based on:
     // - Fields used in equality conditions
     // - Fields used in range conditions
     // - Sort fields
     // Return recommended index specification
   }
   ```

### Expected Output

Create `query_analysis.js` with your profiler and recommendation engine.

## Advanced Exercise 2: Partial and Sparse Indexes

### Objective

Optimize storage and performance using partial and sparse indexes.

### Scenario

The movie collection has many optional fields. Create efficient indexes that only include relevant documents.

### Tasks

1. **Partial Index for Recent Movies**

   ```javascript
   // Index only movies from last 5 years
   db.movies.createIndex(
     { "imdb.rating": -1 },
     {
       partialFilterExpression: {
         year: { $gte: 2019 },
       },
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Sparse Index for Awards**

   ```javascript
   // Index only movies with awards
   db.movies.createIndex({ "awards.wins": -1 }, { sparse: true });
   ```

3. **Compare Performance**
   - Query movies with and without the partial filter
   - Measure index size difference
   - Document space savings

4. **Create Specialized Indexes**
   - High-rated recent movies (rating > 8, year > 2015)
   - Award-winning dramas (has awards, genre includes Drama)
   - Long movies with good ratings (runtime > 150, rating > 7)

### Deliverable

Document findings in `partial_indexes.md` with performance comparisons.

## Advanced Exercise 3: Index Intersection vs. Compound Indexes

### Objective

Understand when MongoDB uses index intersection and compare with compound indexes.

### Tasks

1. **Create Multiple Single-Field Indexes**

   ```javascript
   db.movies.createIndex({ year: 1 });
   db.movies.createIndex({ "imdb.rating": 1 });
   db.movies.createIndex({ genres: 1 });
   ```

2. **Test Index Intersection**

   ```javascript
   // Query that could use index intersection
   db.movies
     .find({
       year: 2015,
       "imdb.rating": { $gte: 8 },
       genres: "Action",
     })
     .explain("executionStats");
   ```

3. **Create Equivalent Compound Index**

   ```javascript
   db.movies.createIndex({
     year: 1,
     "imdb.rating": 1,
     genres: 1,
   });
   ```

4. **Performance Comparison**
   - Document when MongoDB chooses intersection
   - Compare performance metrics
   - Analyze storage overhead
   - Determine best practice guidelines

### Analysis Questions

- When does MongoDB use index intersection?
- What are the performance trade-offs?
- When should you use compound indexes instead?

## Advanced Exercise 4: Aggregation Pipeline Optimization

### Objective

Optimize complex aggregation pipelines for performance.

### Challenge Pipeline

```javascript
// Inefficient pipeline - optimize this!
db.movies.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$cast" },
  { $unwind: "$genres" },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "watchedMovies",
      as: "viewers",
    },
  },
  { $match: { year: { $gte: 2010 } } },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: { actor: "$cast", genre: "$genres" },
      avgRating: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" },
      viewerCount: { $sum: { $size: "$viewers" } },
    },
  },
  { $sort: { viewerCount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 100 },
]);
```

### Optimization Tasks

1. **Reorder Stages**
   - Move $match as early as possible
   - Consider when to $unwind

2. **Eliminate Unnecessary Operations**
   - Can $lookup be avoided?
   - Is double $unwind necessary?

3. **Use Indexes**
   - Create indexes to support $match
   - Consider index for $lookup

4. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Split into multiple simpler pipelines
   - Pre-aggregate common results
   - Use materialized views

### Performance Targets

- Reduce execution time by 50%
- Reduce documents examined by 75%
