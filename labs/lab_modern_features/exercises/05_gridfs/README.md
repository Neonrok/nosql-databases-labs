# Exercise 05 · GridFS File Storage

Store and retrieve large assets using MongoDB GridFS, including metadata lookups and streaming APIs.

## Goals

1. Configure a GridFS bucket and upload/download sample files.
2. Attach metadata/tags and build queries over the `.files` collection.
3. Implement resumable downloads and transform streams for processing files in-flight.

## Files

| File          | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `starter.js`  | Boilerplate for connecting to GridFS and performing basic upload/download actions. |
| `solution.js` | Complete implementation run by `npm run gridfs`.                                   |
| `test.js`     | Minimal sanity test that ensures the exported helpers exist.                       |

## Workflow

1. Seed the GridFS sample via `node setup/initialize_data.js` or upload your own assets.
2. Use `starter.js` to experiment with new flows (chunk sizing, streaming adapters, etc.).
3. Run `node exercises/05_gridfs/test.js` to confirm the module exports the expected API.
