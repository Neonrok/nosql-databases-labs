- Read/Write concerns
- Causal consistency
- Saga pattern implementation
- Distributed locks
- Error handling and retry logic

**Prerequisites:** Completion of Labs 1-5, MongoDB 4.0+ with replica set

---

### Lab Extra 02: Sharding & Horizontal Scaling

**Folder:** `lab_extra_02_sharding/`

**Topics Covered:**

- Sharding architecture and components
- Choosing optimal shard keys
- Setting up sharded clusters
- Zone sharding for geo-distribution
- Chunk balancing and migration
- Query routing and optimization
- Monitoring shard distribution

**Prerequisites:** Completion of Labs 1-5, MongoDB 4.4+, Multiple instances or Docker

---

### Lab Extra 03: Indexing Strategies & Advanced Performance

**Folder:** `lab_extra_03_indexing/`

**Topics Covered:**

- All MongoDB index types (single, compound, multikey, text, geo, wildcard)
- Index selection strategies (ESR rule)
- Query optimization with explain plans
- Performance profiling and monitoring
- Text search optimization
- Geospatial queries
- Index maintenance and management

**Prerequisites:** Completion of Labs 1-5, MongoDB 5.0+

## Getting Started

**Important:** Before running any JavaScript files, please refer to [FILE_USAGE_GUIDE.md](FILE_USAGE_GUIDE.md) to understand which files should be run with Node.js vs MongoDB Shell (mongosh).

Each lab is self-contained with its own:

- `README.md` - Detailed instructions and exercises
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- Implementation files - Sample code and utilities
- Test files - Validation scripts

### Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure MongoDB is running:**

   ```bash
   # Check if MongoDB is running
   mongosh --eval "db.version()"

   # If not running, start MongoDB service
   # Windows: net start MongoDB
   # Mac: brew services start mongodb-community
   # Linux: sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired lab:**

   ```bash
   cd lab_extra_01_transactions/
   # or
   cd lab_extra_02_sharding/
   # or
   cd lab_extra_03_indexing/
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run setup (if available):**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

5. **Follow the lab README instructions**

**Note:** All database interaction uses `mongosh` (MongoDB Shell). The term `mongod` only appears when referring to the server process itself.

## Learning Path Recommendations

### For Database Administrators:

1. Start with **Lab Extra 03** (Indexing) - Critical for performance
2. Continue with **Lab Extra 02** (Sharding) - Scaling strategies
3. Complete with **Lab Extra 01** (Transactions) - Data consistency

### For Application Developers:

1. Start with **Lab Extra 01** (Transactions) - Application patterns
2. Continue with **Lab Extra 03** (Indexing) - Query optimization
3. Optional: **Lab Extra 02** (Sharding) - Understanding infrastructure

### For Full-Stack Engineers:

Complete all three labs in order (01 → 02 → 03) for comprehensive knowledge

---

## Time Estimates

- **Lab Extra 01:** 3-4 hours (including exercises)
- **Lab Extra 02:** 4-5 hours (cluster setup + exercises)
- **Lab Extra 03:** 3-4 hours (including performance testing)

**Total:** 10-13 hours for all extra labs
