## 1. Learning goals

By completing these labs, you should be able to:

- Understand the key differences between relational and NoSQL databases.
- Design schemas for document, key-value, column-family, and/or graph databases.
- Implement typical operations: CRUD, indexing, aggregation, and simple analytics.
- Reason about consistency, replication, and sharding in NoSQL systems.
- Evaluate trade-offs between modeling choices and query performance.

The exact topics and depth may vary by edition of the course; see `syllabus.md` if provided.

## 2. Tooling & Setup Checklist

| Tool                          | Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MongoDB Community Edition 6.x | Run local single instances + replica sets                        |
| mongosh                       | Primary interface (all `solutions.js` scripts are mongosh-based) |
| MongoDB Database Tools        | `mongoimport`, `mongorestore`, `mongodump`, etc.                 |
| Node.js 18+ (optional)        | Some helper scripts/tests use Node                               |
| Git + Editor                  | Manage submissions, edit scripts, take notes                     |

### First-Time Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diogoribeiro7/nosql-databases-labs.git
cd nosql-databases-labs
npm install        # optional, needed for lint/tests
```

- Copy `.env.example` files where applicable (e.g., `labs/lab_modern_features/.env.example` -> `.env`).
- Start MongoDB locally or `docker compose up` if you prefer containers.
- Import starter data via `mongosh labs/<lab>/import_data*.js`.
- Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making contributions or opening PRs.

## 3. Repository Structure (What Matters Where)

```
nosql-databases-labs/
|-- README.md
|-- instructions/
|   |-- project_guidelines.md
|   |-- submission_guide.md
|-- data/
|-- docs/
|-- exercises/
|-- labs/
|   |-- lab01_intro/

```

Each lab folder contains:

1. `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, and exercise markdowns.
2. Mongosh-first scripts (`import_data*.js`, `queries_mongosh.js`, `solutions.js`).
3. Automated tests (Node or mongosh) invoked by GitHub Actions + `npm run test:labs`.

## 4. Getting Started

### 4.1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/diogoribeiro7/nosql-databases-labs.git
cd nosql-databases-labs
```

### 4.2. Import Sample Data

Before starting the labs, import the sample datasets into MongoDB:

1. **Quick Start**: See the [MongoDB Data Import Instructions](./instructions.md) for detailed guidance.
2. **Example**: Import a dataset using mongoimport:
   ```bash
   mongoimport --db training --collection books --file data/datasets/books.json --jsonArray
   ```

Each lab also has optional practice exercises documented in `exercises/` with corresponding solutions in `exercises/solutions/` for self-paced students.

### 4.4. Performance Expectations

Each lab includes target data sizes, latency goals, and timing budgets so you can verify your environment before tackling the deeper exercises. Review [`docs/performance_expectations.md`](docs/performance_expectations.md) for the per-lab checklist and link it from your lab notes when reporting metrics.

### 4.5. Testing & Validation

Automated test suites exist for Labs 01-05. Run them locally with:

```bash
npm run test:labs
```

See [`docs/testing_framework.md`](docs/testing_framework.md) for per-lab commands, advanced benchmarks, and CI integration details.

### 4.6. Extending the Lab Framework

Instructors or contributors who want to add new labs should follow [`docs/extending_lab_framework.md`](docs/extending_lab_framework.md). It covers directory structure, README expectations, starter data/scripts, and how to update repository metadata when introducing additional content.

### 4.7. Self-Paced Learning Paths

Not sure what to tackle next? Follow the recommended sequences in [`docs/self_paced_paths.md`](docs/self_paced_paths.md). It outlines the core labs, advanced tracks, modern features lab, and optional projects.

### 4.8. Feedback & Collaboration

- **Issues:** Report bugs/missing instructions or propose enhancements via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/diogoribeiro7/nosql-databases-labs/issues). Tag the relevant lab (`lab03`, `docs`, `data`, etc.) so maintainers triage quickly.
- **Discussions:** Ask conceptual questions, share your solutions, or suggest improvements in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/diogoribeiro7/nosql-databases-labs/discussions). The instructor and TAs monitor these threads and often highlight best practices. Always search existing threads before opening a new one.
- **Code of Conduct:** All interactions must follow [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## 5. Available Datasets

See `data/README.md` for an overview of the 30+ JSON/NDJSON/BSON datasets bundled with the repo, including sample_airbnb, sample_mflix, sample_supplies, and more.  
Remember to run the data smoke tests (`npm run test:data`) any time you pull new changes so data integrity issues are caught early.

---

## 6. Tooling & Quality Checks

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test:data
npm run test:labs
```

`npm test` runs lint + data smoke tests. CI mirrors these steps, then spins up MongoDB to execute lab scripts. If you add/remove data files, update `scripts/data-manifest.json` so the smoke tests remain accurate.

---

## 7. Contributing & Pull Requests

- Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow, tooling, and submission standards.
- Review the detailed [Pull Request Guide](./pull_requests.md) and use the template stored in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in every interaction.
- Group deliverables must follow the structure defined in [`group-work/README.md`](./group-work/README.md).
- When filing issues, select the appropriate template under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
